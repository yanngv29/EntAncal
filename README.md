Using Ancal Android Calendar open source project and adding the ical "ENT Le mans" iCal Connector.

First Step : 
   understand how Ancal work and which Ancal version to used.
     - i look at original Ancal version and 2 fork existing under github.
       - i make the decision to start with the original version and why not use some of the evolution from the other fork.
   and where did i add :
     - options like login/password / refresh delay.
